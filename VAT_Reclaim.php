<p><b>VAT repayments to self builders
(&quot;D.i.Y.&quot;)</b></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#ff0000" size="4">Fixed-fee &quot;Economy Class&quot; for
small / medium-size claims</font></p>
<p align="left">Help is at hand for the time-short budget-conscious self builder
who needs the money but can't get all the bills into order for the VAT repayment
claim.</p>
<p>Alongside the successful &quot;Advise and Claim&quot; scheme which has been running for
ten years, the leading ex-Customs &amp; Excise self-build specialist Michael Flint
now offers a simple no-frills fixed price claim-making service. The service will
appeal especially to the self builder who knows the VAT rules, particularly the
official VAT Notice 719, but who needs someone with the time and skills to put
in a neat, tidy and accurate claim to the VAT Office at Birmingham. </p>
<p>The maximum claim at the fixed fee rate is £10,000 VAT (or more at my sole
discretion); for claims which you expect to be larger, please use my &quot;Advise and
Claim&quot; service.</p>
<p>The main fee does not become due for payment until the VAT Office issues its
decision on the claim. The actual VAT repayment normally follows shortly
afterwards, and goes straight from HMRC (HM Revenue &amp; Customs) to your bank
account. You will be asked to pay a £100 deposit towards the commencement of
work on the claim and towards costs which include the despatch of your claim (up
to weight 10 kg) to HMRC by Special Delivery including Consequential Loss
insurance. </p>

<p><font color="#ff0000" size="4">&quot;Advise and Claim&quot; for medium-size or larger
claims, and for self builders who wisely seek advice before they build or who
have questions about VAT at any time</font></p>
<p>The original &quot;Advise and Claim&quot; service is the choice for self builders who,
for example, are not so familiar with the VAT rules and regulations and who feel
that they would benefit from a VAT expert's eye being cast over their project
before the foundations are laid. It is the best-value scheme if you are nowhere
near completion of the build, also for claims in respect of unconventional
buildings, and for any claim over £10,000 VAT - at which level a claim may be
subject to greater scrutiny by H.M.R.C.</p>
<p>&quot;Advise and Claim&quot; provides free VAT consultations (usually remote, by
e-mail, telephone or post) throughout the self build project and even
afterwards, and also includes troubleshooting such as claiming back VAT from
contractors who have overcharged it. </p>
<p>&quot;Advise and Claim&quot; ensures quicker preparation and submission of the claim to
the VAT Office (HMRC), and more frequent contact with the claimant about
progress at all stages. The cost differential between &quot;Advise and Claim&quot; and the
Fixed-Fee &quot;Economy Class&quot; may well be repaid several times over if you, the self
builder, are helped to increase your claim by having good VAT advice before and
while you are building your new home. </p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#ff0000" size="4">&quot;First Class&quot; <br>
This is a level of service which is simply &quot;first class&quot; for discerning clients,
whatever kind of qualifying building project, large or small. </font></p>
<p>Naturally, your case will receive the highest priority attention (immediate
if possible), as admission to First Class is limited by capacity. I can visit
you for no extra fee cost* anywhere in UK. You will receive additional advice
and support during the build period if you contact me soon enough. </p>
<p>Additional checks and analysis will be made of your claim during preparation,
to ensure 100% accuracy and maximisation of your entitlement. A high standard of
presentation is guaranteed, and a superior quality copy of the claim will be
made and posted to you at the time it is submitted to HMRC. </p>

<p><b><font size="4">Fees and Costs :</font></b><font size="4"> </font></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><b>All classes or categories of service:</b></font> a
£100 fee is charged for the initial examination of your documents, for notifying
you of your eligibility to receive a VAT repayment (in my opinion), and for
acceptance and then commencement of processing the documents, and as an advance
towards costs. If a normal claim can be submitted following a successful initial
examination, the £100 will be treated as an &quot;advance&quot; and will be credited
against your final bill if you have been accepted into any one of the three
optional fee schemes shown here. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The fixed-fee <font color="#000080"><b>Economy service</b></font> costs <b>
  <font color="#000080">£550.</font></b> </li>
  <li>The <b><font color="#000080">Advise and Claim</font></b> premium service
  costs <b><font color="#000080">£550 plus 1½% </font></b>of the VAT recovered.
  </li>
  <li>The <font color="#000080"><b>First Class</b> </font>service will be
  provided subject to available capacity at any given time, usually for a fee in
  the range <font color="#000080"><b>7.5% to 10%</b> of the VAT recovered</font>,
  First Class is subject to the minimum charge shown here. The required
  remuneration is considered on a case-by-case basis and is normally not decided
  until I have examined your documentation and have confirmed that I can give
  you the appropriate high priority service; it is naturally dependent on the
  efficient performance of the work and your complete satisfaction with it. The
  minimum charge is <font color="#000080">£575 plus 1½% of the VAT recovered.</font>
  </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>*travel fares &amp; subsistence payable if I visit you, but time is included on
First Class tariff. </p>
<p>All Claims:- see full terms and conditions but normally the following main
terms apply: </p>
<p>1) All fees are for work done; they are not commissions, whether or not
calculated by reference to the amount of VAT repaid to you by HMRC or a trader.</p>
<p>2) £100 advance of fee payable when the work is accepted, but no further
payment normally required until you have received the VAT repayment, (assuming
that the claim is accepted in principle by HMRC, regardless of the quantum); </p>
<p>3) The balance of my fee will be notified by invoice when HMRC has reached a
decision on your claim. <br>
<br>
4) Non-payment or late payment of any of my fees which have been charged by
reference to the special fee formulae shown in this leaflet or the internet
version thereof or by reference to any other preferential terms applied to an
invoice will render the client liable to pay a higher fee upon presentation to
the client of an invoice showing the charge for the work by reference to my
standard (full hourly rate) fee tariff applied to a reasonable estimate of the
time which was spent on the work; and in addition, the £100 advance paid in
accordance with Condition 2 above will be forfeit.</p>
<p>5) there is a surcharge of £1 per till-roll receipt if you want me to process
more than about 25 small receipts which are printed off a retailer's till-roll,
not being full-page tax invoices issued by a builders' merchant. I can tell you
how to avoid this charge without losing the VAT which HMRC might repay to you.</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">Notwithstanding the above, fees are set
and agreed on a case-by-case basis. VAT will not be added to these fees until
such time as I register for VAT in accordance with the VAT Regulations which
specify the amount of turnover (gross income) at which I will be required to
register for VAT and account for it on fees received.</font></p>
