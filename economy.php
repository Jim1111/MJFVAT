<p>Clients who expect their claim to exceed £10,000 or who need advice about the
VAT system and rates of VAT should use my superior Advise &amp; Claim or First Class systems. For example, I often find that clients have overpaid VAT to their
building contractor or other tradesmen, and I seek recovery of such overcharges
from the firm or tradesman because HMRC will not repay the excess to you. </p>
