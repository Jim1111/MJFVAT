<p>Established on 1st January 1996</p>

<p>Principle : <b>Michael Flint</b></p>

<p>The consultancy began work in January 1996, initially part-time, following
Michael's long career in the Civil Service. Prior to joining Customs and Excise
(&quot;C &amp; E&quot;) in 1973, he gained useful experience in headquarters
offices of other central government departments, hence his broader outlook and
more flexible approach than you might expect in a civil servant from a revenue
department.</p>

<p>Nevertheless his time as a senior grade VAT officer in area offices and
latterly as a buildings VAT policy adviser and caseworker in C&amp;E
headquarters in London is an essential prerequisite for the practical style of
consultancy now offered.</p>

<p>He admits to finding life tougher on the &quot;outside&quot;, particularly as
a sole practitioner, but when success comes - as it has on some occasions at the
VAT &amp; Duties Tribunal - the job is all the more satisfying.
