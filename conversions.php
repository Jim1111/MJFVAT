<p><b>Convervions</b></p>
<p>Relief from the UK government's VAT is available for the conversion of a
non-residential building into a dwelling. VAT is charged by builders who do the
work of conversion, and VAT is payable on the purchase of the building
materials.<img alt="Michael Flint helped the owner of Raddle Farm near Tamworth, England, to reclaim VAT which had been paid on the cost of converting the large barn into a family house." src="images/barnpic2.jpg" align="right" border="0" hspace="20" vspace="20" width="305" height="181"><br>

Michael Flint helped the owner of Raddle Farm near Tamworth, England, (pictured)
to reclaim VAT which had been paid on the cost of converting the large barn into
a family house. To be eligible for a VAT repayment, it is important that the
house is self-contained and not ancillary (subsidiary) to another house.<br>
<br>
Advice and guidance through the rules and regulations is given by the Michael
Flint VAT consultancy. The claim for a repayment of VAT can be submitted to the
government on behalf of the home-owner.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Advise and Claim&quot; scheme is now available to you. Unlimited VAT advice and
total management of your VAT repayment claim - making sure that you get the most
- all for one inclusive fee payable at the end of the self-build project, not at
the beginning. This is the premium (top) grade service for self-builders, and is
used by self-builders who expect the the very best advice and the maximum
possible VAT repayment in the shortest possible time.

A new economy-class Claims service is now offered to self-builders. This low
cost service should appeal to self-builders who just want their existing
documents processed to produce a VAT refund all in good time.
