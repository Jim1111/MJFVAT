<p><b>Advise and Claim</b></p>

<p><b><font color="#ff0000" size="4">&quot;Advise and Claim&quot; for medium-size or
larger claims, and for self builders who wisely seek advice before they build or
who have questions about VAT at any time</font></b></p>


<p>The original &quot;Advise and Claim&quot; service is the regular choice for self
builders who, for example, are not so familiar with the VAT rules and
regulations and who feel that they would benefit from a VAT expert's eye being
cast over their project before the foundations are laid. It is the best-value
scheme if you are nowhere near completion of the build, also for claims in
respect of unconventional buildings, and for any claim over £10,000 VAT - at
which level a claim may be subject to greater scrutiny by H.M.R.C.</p>

<p>&quot;Advise and Claim&quot; provides free VAT consultations (usually
remote, by e-mail, telephone or post) throughout the self build project and even
afterwards, and also includes troubleshooting such as claiming back VAT from
contractors who have overcharged it.</p>

<p>&quot;Advise and Claim&quot; ensures quicker preparation and submission
of the claim to the VAT Office (HMRC), and more frequent contact with the
claimant about progress at all stages. The cost differential between &quot;Advise and
Claim&quot; and the Fixed-Fee &quot;Economy Class&quot; may well be repaid several times over
if you, the self builder, are helped to increase your claim by having good VAT
advice before and while you are building your new home.</p>

<p>Your VAT repayment claim can be professionally prepared by Michael Flint, a
former senior officer of HM Customs &amp; Excise, now HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</p>

<p>For one inclusive fee payable when you get your refund of VAT, &quot;Advise &amp; Claim&quot;
offers you:</p>
