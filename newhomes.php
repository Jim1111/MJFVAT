<p><b>New Homes</b></p>
<p>Constructing a new house has always been free from UK VAT. &quot;Self build&quot; home
owners (people managing the building project themselves, instead of buying a
complete house from a property developer) can claim back VAT which they have
paid on building materials which they bought themselves.<br>
<br>
VAT repayments are made by HM Revenue &amp; Customs, the government department which
collects VAT in the UK. Taking professional advice may enable you to maximise
the amount of the repayment; and an accurate claim will generally be passed for
payment quicker than a faulty over-stated claim.<br>

<p><i>New house in East Sussex, and another successful VAT reclaim by the
owner-occupier.<br>
<br>
My client built an identical house for sale, the VAT was reclaimed though the
normal system of VAT Returns used by businesses (instead of making a lump-sum
claim).</i></p>
